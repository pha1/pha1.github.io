        <h1>Dungeon Crawler</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Dungeon Crawler! This is a simple dungeon crawling game, where the player gets to explore a dungeon, battle creatures, and find treasure.</p>

        <!-- This is the container for the game itself. Make it visually appealing somehow. Design a "game console" essentially. -->
        <div id="game-container">

            <!-- Here the game is displayed, think this as the display screen/monitor --> 
            <div id="game-display"></div>

            <!-- More onto this later, but this is where all the controls will be. How to make it simple, yet transitional? -->
