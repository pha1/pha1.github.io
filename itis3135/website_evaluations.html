        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>

                <p>This is the official Apple webpage. It is the homepage. Overall this page advertises their newest products. It is very simple, yet promotes the company and does its job very well.</p>
                <ul class="CRAPList">
                    <li>Contrast: The initial image, as of the time I am writing this is a dark background with a glowing image of the logo in the center. The text is written in the color white above this background.
                        The rest of the page is the opposite with white background, and black for the text. This contrast makes it easy for the viewer to see what is going on.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetition:  The same text is used throughout the webpage. Color scheme is similar from top to bottom. And the font size matches in each section.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The text is centered aligned in the sections that they are in. The page is split in two, image on one side, text center-aligned on the other side.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Images are placed right by their title. The spacing in between all items on the page are just enough for the viewer to read and see everything easily.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
        
                <p>This is the Yale School of Art webpage. It functions as a wiki, such that any student or professor may update the page. This webpage is very different than most you would see. It has a lot going on.</p>
                <p>But simply put, this webpage shows the school news and you have access to their publications and exhibitions. If you wish to apply to the school there is a link on the left hand side.</p>
                <ul class="CRAPList">
                    <li>Contrast: There are many colors used in this webpage. The colors at the moment of this writing: yellow, white, green, and orange. The background image is repeated throughout the page, 
                        yet it is very distracting and makes the items above it hard to read.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetition: The background is repeated over and over. Font size is different throughout page. The style is repeated, but used in such a way that it hurts the eyes to continue to go through the webpage.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The page is left-aligned. Most text is contained on the left, barely reaching the center of the page. Although aligned together, they do not make use of the full page.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: The whole page is left-aligned. The text feels clustered and too close to one another. Images are placed directly under the titles.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
