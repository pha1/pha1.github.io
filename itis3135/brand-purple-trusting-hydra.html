        <h2>Brand Page</h2>
        <p class="main-para">Purple Trusting Hydra is a web design company that started up to help teach students basic HTML language. We offer interactive lessons to students and any person looking to learn HTML.
            We offer unique designs, allowing clients to request specific constraints to their websites. We will do our best to fulfill the client's desire; with any difficulties of the design we will contact the client and 
            deal with the issues. We are willing to accept changes as the project moves forward, but the client must understand the affects it will have on the budget and deadline of the project.

                <li>Purple Trusting Hydra started as a company of 5! That's why there are 5 heads in the logo.</li>
                <li>An interesting story about the company: The founder chose the color purple to honor his grandfather's passed down classic 1967 mustang. Through the years it was damaged and thought to be done for. With the support of friends
                    and family, the founder was able to restore the vehicle. It was bold with its purple color. He expresses that the color represents cheefulness and playfulness. Its associated with escape from reality and magical images.
